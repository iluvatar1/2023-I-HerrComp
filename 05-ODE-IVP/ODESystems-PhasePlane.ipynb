    "A parachutist is under free-fall and under linear viscous damping modeled as $$f_v = -m b v,$$ where $m$ is the mass, $b$ is the damping constant, and $v$ is the vertical velocity. How does $b$ affects the final equilibrium velocity? The final equilibrium velocity happens when there is no acceleration, that is, when $ma = 0 = -mg -mbv_f$, so $$v_f = -g/b.$$ Show that numerically as way to calibrate the method. Create a function that receives the value of $b$ and returns the finla velocity. Notice that you will need to simulate the system for a very long time (or, much better, use an event as we will show later). Plot $v_f$ versus $b$. Use $M = 60.7$ kg and $G = 9.81$ m/s$^2$. "

When $a=0$, $x$ does not change at all ,$x(t) = x_0$, and we have a family of stable nodes along the $x$-axis, or a **line of fixed points**.

From the definition, $(0, 0)$ is always a fixed point. In the case of the harmonic oscillator, the origin is called a focus (since all orbits are around it but never touch it). For the damped harmonic oscillator, the origin is called an stable equilibrium point, snce it attracts all the trajectories in the phase plane. Soon we will learn more classifications.\n",
